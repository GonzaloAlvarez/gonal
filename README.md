## Scope
Homepage for Gonzalo Alvarez - [gon.al](https://gon.al) and its blog [gon.al/b](https://gon.al/b/)

## History
For a long time I've been looking into tools to create a nice blog. Static seems like the way to go. Also, the home page and portfolio should be static. Jekyll/Pelican/Octopress all look like pretty good alternatives, but a bit too cluttered and a bit too constrained.

[Hexo](https://hexo.io/) came to the rescue. I've built a universe from scratch based on [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) and [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/)
for the [front page](https://gon.al/) and use the wonderful Hexo for the [Blog](https://gon.al/b/).

For the blog theme, I've based my work on the [Tranquilpeak](https://github.com/LouisBarranqueiro/tranquilpeak-hexo-theme) theme, although I've made several modifications on my own.
