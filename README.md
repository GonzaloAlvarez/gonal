## Scope
Homepage for Gonzalo Alvarez - [gon.al](https://gon.al) and its blog [gon.al/b](https://gon.al/b/)

## History
For a long time I've been looking into tools to create a nice blog. Static seems like the way to go. Also, the home page and portfolio should be static. Jekyll/Pelican/Octopress all look like pretty good alternatives, but a bit too cluttered and a bit too constrained.

I decided to build a universe from scratch.
