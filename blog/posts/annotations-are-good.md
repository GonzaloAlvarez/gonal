While people say – it’s easier to read the Code, it’s easier to debug the code with annotations in the mix, they forget what’s it’s not code in code anymore – they have embedded configuration in code. And as far as I remember Configurations were supposed to be externalized. The problem is more severe in cases where we use ORM frameworks like Hibernate and JPA.
